It is popular because it is widely used in industries, it has lot of libraries , and easy to learn .\n","#2 What is an interpreter in Python ?\n","   A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine instructions instantly. It enables running Python scripts without compiling them first, making coding and debugging fast and interactive.\n","#3 What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","   Pre-defined keywords in Pythonholds a special meanings that define the special pourpose. These keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because they serve specific functions like control flow, function definition, and more (e.g., if, else, for, while, def, class).\n","#4 Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","   Keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for the programming language's syntax and have predefined meanings. Using keywords as variable names will cause errors or unexpected behavior in the code.\n","#5 What is mutability in Python ?\n","   Mutability in Python refers to an object's ability to have its value or state changed after it has been created. Mutable objects, like lists and dictionaries, can be altered without changing their identity, whereas immutable objects, like strings and tuples, cannot be changed once created.\n","\n","#6 Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","   Lists are mutable because they are designed to allow modifications such as adding, removing, or changing elements after creation. Tuples are immutable to provide a fixed, unchangeable sequence which is useful for protecting data.\n","#7 What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in   Python ?\n","   \"==\" checks if two things have the same value, like two identical apples.\n","   \"is\" checks if two things are actually the exact same object, like the same apple looked at twice\n","#8 What are logical operators in Python?\n","   Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and return True or False based on logical relationships. The three main logical operators are and, or, and not.\n","#9 What is type casting in Python?\n","   Type casting in Python is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. it can done  explicitly or implicitly as needed\n","#10 What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","   The difference between implicit and explicit type casting is that implicit type casting happens automatically by the compiler when converting data types, while explicit type casting requires to manually specify the conversion. Implicit casting is automatic and convenient, whereas explicit casting gives more control but requires clear instructions from the programmer.\n","#11 What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","   The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to make decisions in a program by executing certain blocks of code only if specific conditions are true or false. They control the flow of the program, allowing it to behave differently in different situations based on those conditions.\n","#12 How does the elif statement work?\n","   The elif statement in Python checks another condition if the previous if statement is false. It allows multiple conditions to be tested sequentially until one is true, then executes the corresponding code block\n","#13 What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","   The difference between for and while loops is:\n","   A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance, iterating over a sequence or a range.\n","   A while loop runs as long as a given condition remains true, and is used when the number of iterations is not   predetermined.\n","#14 Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","   A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations is unknown and the loop needs to continue based on a condition, such as waiting for user input or reading data until a certain event occurs. In contrast, a for loop is ideal when the number of iterations is predetermined or fixed, like iterating over a range or a collection of items"],"metadata":{"id":"XOVkHaWyxYgB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["practical questions"],"metadata":{"id":"W_iTQnL78TSZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1 Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World! ?\n","print(\"Hello,world!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bfR8_-IM-JXy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758168113932,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":27,"user":{"displayName":"Aniket","userId":"04894553593145630387"}},"outputId":"54e8c199-1f0a-49ea-cd98-b5a14727b532"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello,world!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2 Write a Python program that displays your name and age?\n","\n","name = \"rishabh\"\n","age = 27\n","print(\"my name is\", name)\n","print(\"i am\", age, \"years old\" )"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AZUdKuFU_Tc4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758168503008,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Aniket","userId":"04894553593145630387"}},"outputId":"4bd32215-4a8e-43d2-8ddd-e9a66461452f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["my name is rishabh\n","i am 27 years old\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#3 Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library?\n","\n","import keyword\n","print(\"all keywords are:\")\n","print(keyword,keyword.kwlist)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"SmH5R_n9Apip","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758169094815,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":37,"user":{"displayName":"Aniket","userId":"04894553593145630387"}},"outputId":"7085eddc-0014-4a8a-95db-31f51206dadc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["all keywords are:\n","<module 'keyword' from '/usr/lib/python3.12/keyword.py'> ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#4 Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword.\n","\n","import keyword\n","def check_keyword(word):\n","    if keyword.iskeyword(word):\n","        print(f'\"{word}\" is a Python keyword.')\n","    else:\n","        print(f'\"{word}\" is NOT a Python keyword.')\n","check_keyword(\"for\")\n","check_keyword(\"while\")\n","check_keyword(\"hello\")\n","check_keyword(\"lambda\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"oUYFIOZ9Sr37","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758173259444,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Aniket","userId":"04894553593145630387"}},"outputId":"64f7f478-20c5-4e35-e6b3-002a766befbb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\"for\" is a Python keyword.\n","\"while\" is a Python keyword.\n","\"hello\" is NOT a Python keyword.\n","\"lambda\" is a Python keyword.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#5 .
